# 1 Background
The internet has revolutionized the way we shop. With the advent of online shopping, we have experienced comfort and freedom of shopping almost anything, at any time, and from anywhere. But, as is the case with every technological advancement there are cons of online shopping. Disadvantages like - risk of fraud, unprecedented delays in receiving the products, lack of customized attention are to name a few.

To mitigate some of the cons, a large number of IoT (Internet of Things) sensors being used in the supply chain management these days. Supply chain is an entire system of producing and delivering a product or service, from sourcing the raw materials to the final delivery of the product or service to end users. IoT devices have added a layer of information to this management system by — tracking the location of products, both at rest and in motion; capturing real-time shipment and inventory visibility and tracking; identifying issues with goods getting lost or delayed; etc. This supply chain data generated by the IoT devices, when churned efficiently, can help the companies to make - predictions, recommendations, identify hidden patterns for better decision making in the future. However, with a lot of options available to analyze data, it often becomes difficult to decide which machine learning (ML) model to use.

# 2 Project Plan
- Use different ML models and assess their performances to perform Fraud Detection.
- Demonstrated data preprocessing steps.
- Leveraged various feature selection methods — Filter method, Wrapper method (Step-wise), Embedded (Lasso and Elastic Net) to deduce the most significant set of predictors.
- Implemented classification models to detect fraudulent transactions — Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Bagging, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Boosting.
- Evaluated the performance measures of these models and have preseneted a comparative study.

# 3 Dataset Description
The data set used in this project is maintained transparently with the Creative Commons 4.0 license through the Mendeley data repository. The data set consists of roughly 180k transactions from supply chains used by the company DataCo Global for over a period of three years.
### 3.1 Source

### 3.2 Description
The data set consists of 3 files:
- Transaction Data: Structured supply chain transaction data ’DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv’
- Log Data: Unstructured transaction log data ’tokenized access logs’
- Column Description: Structured data ’DescriptionDataCoSupplyChain.csv’
The ‘Transaction Data’, which has some 53 columns, has a mix of categorical and quantitative values. The primary objective is to build a fraud detection using this data set.

### 3.3 Data Visualization
-  Proportion of ‘SUSPECTED FRAUD’ is much lower than the order statuses. The data imbalance is likely to cause incorrect prediction. Therefore, up-sampling or down-sampling would be required to mitigate the data imbalance.
- Africa has the lowest number of transactions. This could be a potential market for the company.
- Maximum transaction types are ‘Debit’ and the minimmum is ‘Cash’ transactions.
- From the sales data we also find that most of the deliveries made by DataCo Global are ‘Late Delivery’. This might be a potential setback for the company’s business and turnover.
